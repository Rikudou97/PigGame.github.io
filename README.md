The game was created during `The Complete JavaScript Course 2023: From Zero to Expert!~, from Udemy.

A simple dice game created using Javascript, HTML and CSS. Press the 'roll dice' button to... well, roll the dice. 
You can roll the dice as many times as you want, but if you roll a 1, you lose your turn, and your opponent can roll the dice instead of you. 
Sometimes you can win in only one turn if you're lucky enough not to roll a 1. 
You can keep your dice rolls so you can get to 50 points. First player to hit 50 points wins.
